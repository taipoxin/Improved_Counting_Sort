# Improved_Counting_Sort
Improved and standard implementation

Improved Counting Sort:
    *same or less used memory (arrays from min to max versus arrays from 1 to max)
    *same complexity
    *can works with negative numbers
    *almost same running time (added only one O(n) loop to find min and max values)
